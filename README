This PHP script is a proof of concept XBMC library import to trakt. It uses the XBMC HTTP API to query your movies, determine which ones have been watched, and submit the data to trakt.

You can get your trakt API key:
	http://trakt.tv/settings/api

More info on the trakt API calls can be found:

	http://dev.trakt.tv/api-docs/movie-library
	http://dev.trakt.tv/api-docs/show-episode-seen
	http://dev.trakt.tv/api-docs/show-episode-library

NOTE: This script should technically work on boxee and plex since they use the XBMC HTTP API as well.
